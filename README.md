This is a movie website built using React and Chakra UI. The project features a responsive design with a dynamic game/movie grid, genre selection, and light/dark mode toggle. Data is fetched from the RAWG API, making it interactive and up-to-date. Ideal for showcasing modern React development practices with hooks and custom reusable components.
